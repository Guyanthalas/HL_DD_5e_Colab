  <thing id="c5CSpirit" name="Spirit" description="The Spirit domain is one of righteous protection against the most unholy of forces: undeath. It channels the power of Good- and Neutral-aligned deities to guide wayward souls and ghosts into the next plane of existence, helping them leave the material plane. When those spirits are uncooperative, or worse, are evil and malign, adherents of this domain are given the power to punish them and banish them to the depths of the hells or abyss. The Spirit Domain is available to followers of deities that oversee the process of life and death, but see undeath as abhorrent.\n\n{b}Domain Spells{/b}\nAt the listed cleric level, you learn the spells associated with this domain.

They become an ideal; a clarion call in the darkness capable of bolstering those who are frightened. To swear this oath is to make yourself an enemy of all\nwho would use terror to manipulate and harm the frightened. Just as you can sense evil and undeath, undeath and evil can sense you. The\narmor and appearance of these paladins is often simple and utilitarian; whatever gets the job done. What’s different about them is their voice: strong, compassionate, and inspiring. It is the voice of a leader in the darkest of times.\n\nThe Oath of Courage has few tenets, but they serve as constant reminders about a paladin’s purpose. Often, paladins will repeat these tenets to themselves in a crisis to strengthen their resolve.\n\n▶▶ Fight the Fear. Fear exists for only one purpose: to be conquered. You must fight the fear in your own heart before you can fight the fear in others.\n\n▶▶ Bolster the Timid. Agents of fear—undead and otherworldly horrors—will try to break your compatriots will with terror. Do not let them. Your courageous example will  make your allies courageous as well.\n\n▶▶ Inspire the Meek. You have taken this oath, but the common person hasn’t. They will be afraid when monsters come to their door. It is your duty to give them the hope, the confidence, and the tools to fight alongside you.\n\n▶▶ Fortify Your Surroundings. To survive the long and terrifying night, you must be prepared. Always be on the lookout for ways to make your surroundings more secure, safe, and defensible. You may be able to survive a night raid, but those you look after may not." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">
