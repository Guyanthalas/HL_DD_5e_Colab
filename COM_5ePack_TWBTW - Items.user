  <thing id="io5CIggCldrn" name="Iggwilv&apos;s Cauldron" description="This wondroud cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it); neither needs to be attuned to it to do so. In one form, it appears to be solid gold and adorned with images of greenery and broomsticks. In the other, it is made of iron and has images of animals on the outside. In either form, the cauldron is about 3 feet in diameter with a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\n\n{b}Attunement.{/b} Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or be aged to the point of infirmity. In this state, the creature&apos;s speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Nothing short of the {i}wish{i} spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\nThree hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, so long as they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.\n\n{b}Random Properties.{/b} Regardless of its form it takes, the cauldron has 1 minor beneficial property and 1 minor detrimental property.\n\n{b}Gold Cauldron.{/b} The gold cauldron has these properties:\n• If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hot, nourishing stew that provides one meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally once removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat.\n• If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir usable by up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that drinks the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn&apos;t consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can&apos;t be used again until the following dawn.\n• When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for the {i}scrying{/i} spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell automatically fails its save, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on separate planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\n• Dipping the bristles of an nonmagical broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a {i}broom of flying{/i} for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can&apos;t be used again until the following dawn.\n\n{b}Iron Cauldron.{/b} The iron cauldron has the following properties:\n• You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a {b}swarm of bats{/b} that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute, if it hasn&apos;t already been destroyed by that point. Once used, this property of the cauldron can&apos;t be used again until the following dawn.\n• If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a harmless, black smoke cloud that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, with the exception of those that are attuned to the cauldron or that are immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can&apos;t be used again until the following dawn.\n• Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a {i}wand of polymorph{/i} with 3 charges. This wand cannot recharge and turns to ash when its last charge is spent. Once used, this property of the cauldron can&apos;t be used again for 8 days.\n• If you spend 1 minute touching a unicorn horn to the cauldron while reciting the poem called &quot;The Witch Queen&apos;s Cauldron&quot; (see The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, page 210), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron, save for those that are attuned to it, become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, cannot move or speak, does not age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Additionally, it can&apos;t be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to a different plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn&apos;s horn for 1 minute while reciting &quot;The Witch Queen&apos;s Cauldron&quot; again ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or that is touched by a unicorn&apos;s horn.\n\n{b}Destroying the Cauldron.{/b} The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to all damage, save for damage from a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size. Shattering it causes all ongoing effects created by the cauldron to end, as it loses its magic.\nThe destruction of Iggwilv&apos;s Cauldron causes all hags across the multiverse to lose their Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven.\n\n{b}Reconstructing the Cauldron.{/b} If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a {i}wish{/i} spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron&apos;s reconstruction likewise restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse." compset="Wondrous">

The creature attuned to the vane can use an action to pinpoint the location of the happiest creature in the carnival.\nThe butterfly shape at the top of the vane slowly spins clockwise when the general mood of the carnival is high. Conversely, if spirits are low, the top of the vane spins slowly counterclockwise.\n\n{b}Sentience.{/b} The vane is a sentient, chaotic good wondrous item with Intelligence 11, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 14. It has hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet, and it communicates through emotions, trasmitted to the creature attuned to it. Its true purpose is to ensure the patrons of the carnival are having a good time.\n\n{b}Additional Properties.{/b} The vane has these additional properties:\n• The creature holding the vane is vulnerable to lightning damage.\n• The creature attuned to the vane is immune to the blinded, deafened, petrified, and stunned conditions.\n• While carrying the vane, the creature attuned to it can use an action to cast one of these spells without needing any spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability: {i}dancing lights{/i}, {i}polymorph{/i}, and {i}ray of frost{/i}. After the vane is used to cast {i}polymorph{/i}, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the vane can&apos;t be used to cast this spell again until the following dawn." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="io5CWtchWat" name="Witchlight Watch" description="This ornate pocket watch is fastened to the end of a gold chain. When opened, it has a faint golden glow and softly ticks, a sound that is only audible to the creature holding it. The watchface is an ornate image of the carnival, with a circle of stones that tell the time.\n\n{b}Carnival Setup and Takedown.{/b} The creature attuned to the watch can use an action to initiate the packing up or the unpacking of the carnival, provided the creature and the carnival are on the same plane of existence. Over the course of an hour, all objects that are part of the carnival are magically moved around until everything is packed up and ready for travel, or unpacked and assembled. The watch does not affect creatures, which can move about freely and safely while the setup/unpacking process occurs. Once the process starts, it can&apos;t be halted until it is finished. Once the watch has been used to pack up or unpack the carnival, this property cannot be used again until 8 hours have passed.\n\n{b}Additional Properties.{/b} The pocket watch has these additional properties:\n• While carrying the watch, the creature attuned to it can use an action to cast one of the following spells, needing no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability: {i}fire bolt{/i}, {i}invisibility{/i}, and {i}message{/i}. After the watch&apos;s {i}invisibility{/i} spell is cast, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the watch can&apos;t be used to cast this spell again until the following dawn.\n• The creature attuned to the watch gains 30 pounds. This extra weight vanishes when the attunement ends.\n• The creature attuned to the watch must eat and drink eight times the normal amount every day." compset="Wondrous">
