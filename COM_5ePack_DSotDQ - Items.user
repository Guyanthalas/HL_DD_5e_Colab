During this trajectory, the creature always reaches a vertical height of 60 feet.\nA creature that collides with another creature or an object during this trajectory takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet away from the gnomeflinger it is." compset="Gear">

The message emits from the speakers of the receiving device and can be heard up to 10 feet away from that device.

Once deployed, the parachute quickly inflates, and you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. When you are 10 feet away from the ground, roll a d20. On a roll of 5 or less, the parachute gives out, and you begin falling normally." compset="Gear">

It shatters and is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.\n\nWhile holding the mirror upright, you can use an action to speak its command word, activating it. While activated, the mirror hovers in the air, and it can be destroyed but is immovable. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again or until your attunement to the mirror ends, at which point the mirror harmlessly floats to the ground. Once the mirror has been deactivated, it can&apos;t be activated again until the next dawn.\n\nIf a non-Construct creature other than you sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or become paralyzed until the mirror is deactivated or until that creature is no longer able to see the mirror. A creature paralyzed by the mirror can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success. If a creature&apos;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this mirror&apos;s effect for the next 24 hours.\n\nWhile paralyzed by the mirror, the creature sees events from their past reflected in the mirror&apos;s glass. These memories aren&apos;t real, but rather idealized versions of those occurrences. Nearby observers can see brief flashes of these memories in the mirror, but only when not looking directly at it." compset="Wondrous">
