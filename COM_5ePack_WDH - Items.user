This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using this staff, you can spend 1 of the staff&apos;s charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already spent all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target complete a long rest, as usual.\n\n{b}Animate Walking Statues{/b}. You can spend 1 or more of the staff&apos;s charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each expended charge. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of the dominant spirit trapped inside the staff. A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n\n{b}Retributive Strike{/b}. You can use an action to break the staff on your knee a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\nYou have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you suffer force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges remaining in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity save.

When you cast a 1st level or higher enchantment spell while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without spending a spell slot.\n\n{b}Sentience{/b}. The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}. The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it, with its creator, Khelben Arunsun, as the dominant personality. Like its creator, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. However, it prefers to offer counsel to its owner rather than exerting outright control. The staff&apos;s primary goal is to protect the city and its lord. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful. The staff will cease to function if the holder of the position of Blackstaff doesn&apos;t serve its wishes. It will only resume functioning once it has found someone completely dedicated to the city.\n\n{b}Spirit Trap{/b}. When the holder of the Blackstaff title dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff. Thus they cannot be raised from the dead.\nDestroying the staff would release the trapped spirits. But the spirit of its creator can stay inside any one existing piece of the staff. The piece containing his spirit has the staff&apos;s Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, the spirit can remake the staff whenever he wants. When it is remade, the previously trapped spirits are trapped once again." compset="Staff">
