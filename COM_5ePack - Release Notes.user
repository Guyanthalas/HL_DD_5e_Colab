<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li>DMG - The Rod of Lordly Might was updated in errata such that button 1, which forms a flame tongue sword, can be any sword of your choosing.

<li>See Known Issues page on the 5e Community Pack Github for previous known issues.</li>
</ul>

The new bonds, flaws, etc. are available to any background when the Ravenloft source is selected. Added Survivors; add them through the encounter builder like normal monsters and use the Race tab to level them up and select talents. Much love to digitalshadowhawk for his work on the dark gifts.</li>
</ul>

<strong>ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES</strong>
<ul>
<li>All - Added new "Hide Deities" adjustment. Will hide your choice of either an entire category of deities or all deities not in a chosen category. </li>

</ul>

<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing - Hero Lab has an issue with scripts requiring you to equip something. Instead of executing as soon as you equip something, they execute once you do something else in the portfolio, like adding an item, changing your HP, etc. Things function correctly, but take another "cycle" to process.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v3.2 - Waterdeep and Candlekeep - April 18, 2021</strong>
<strong>NOTE</strong>
While the official adventures almost always include stat blocks for new monsters, there are also a lot of NPC’s and creatures that are described merely as modifications of existing one, like “Blahblah uses a Mage stat block with the following changes.” Many such monsters are programmed as their own entries in the Community Pack, so a DM can find them in the Encounter Builder. Almost all of these that are NOT in the encounter builder are able to be created using the base stat block and the many, many adjustments available in the Adjustments tab. So one way or another, when the patch notes say all monsters for a book are added, they’re either in the Encounter Builder or can be done with adjustments.
</ul>

<strong>NEW RELEASES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Acquisitions, Inc. - Added five new backgrounds.</li>
<li>Candlekeep Mysteries - Added all items, monsters, and charms.</li>
<li>Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount - Added two new backgrounds.</li>
<li>Mordenkainen's Fiendish Folio - All monsters added.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Subclasses, Part 4 - College of Spirits Bard and Undead Warlock added.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild - Four new lineages added.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Lineages - Three new lineages added.</li>
<li>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist - Added all items and monsters.</li>
<li>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage - Added all items and monsters.</li>
</ul>

<strong>ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES</strong>
<ul>
<li>BGDiA - Added all variant background features. Add them to the PHB backgrounds using the Background Option, Baldur's Gate adjustment.</li>
<li>DMG - Added the siege weapons. They can be found in the gear tab.</li>
<li>DMG - Added a "Generic Object" to the Encounter Builder. Add this to help track an object's AC and HP in the Tactical Console; its size, material, and durability are adjustable per the rules in the DMG. Use adjustments to tweak its stats as needed.</li>
<li>GoS - Added the additional Saltmarsh-specific options to existing backgrounds. The Noble’s extra origins table can be enabled via a Saltmarsh backgrounds adjustment.</li>
<li>HotDQ - Updated the extra background Bonds to make it clear they’re from this adventure, and reorganized list to not intermingle them with default Bond options.</li>
<li>MToF - Added the three astral vehicles. They can be found in the gear tab. Also added Blessed of Corellon as a Supernatural Gift.</li>
<li>OotA - Updated the extra background Bonds to make it clear they’re from this adventure, and reorganized list to not intermingle them with default Bond options.</li>
<li>PHB - Added more adjustments: weapon attack effect, weapon extra damage, weapon target, melee weapon reach.</li>
<li>SCAG - Tweaked Bladesong to provide Int mod in Con save situational note.</li>
<li>TCoE - Changed the Genie's Vessel from a piece of gear to a wondrous item, and ensured it can't be manually added.</li>
<li>ToA - Added the many inhabitations from the tomb as supernatural gifts.</li>
</ul>

<strong>BUGS</strong>
<ul>
<li>All - More typos corrected.</li>
<li>MTOF - Fixed the Tiefling variants to have the correct spell names and indicate the level they’re being cast as. Thanks to ShadowRose for the catch and the fixes.</li>
<li>MTOF - Cleanup of incorrect and duplicate deities.</li>
<li>SCAG - Fixed the double Performance proficiency from Training in War and Song. Bug reported by ShadowRose.</li>
<li>TCoE - Fixed Telepathic feat to remove Shadow Touched stuff. Fixed Eldritch Mind to remove Tome of the Pact requirement. Thanks ShadowRose for the reports and fixes.</li>
<li>UA Feats - Fixed Spear Mastery to also benefit ranged spear attacks. Thanks to ShadowRose for the bug report.</li>
<li>Other - Removed some old coding that handled Kobold Press sources, which was presumably broken by a Hero Lab update at some point.</li>
</ul>

<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li>UA - When a lineage grants multiple creature types, Humanoid sometimes overwrites and hides the others. To avoid this, we have to push the secondary type to "overwrite," allowing both to be displayed. This makes the secondary type appear higher and display on the stat block. This isn't an issue with any programming (yet) but it may look strange. Please report any bugs you think may be related.</li>
</ul>

<li>MOoT - Added adjustment to add the Piety tracker to a character, in case they don’t have one already. Also added an adjustment to add Nyxborn traits to a creature.</li>
<li>OGA - Source added for One Grung Above adventure. The Grung has been in the pack for years, but apparently never made it into the patch notes. Surprise!</li>
<li>PHB - Added many adjustments: add or remove spell slots, condition immunity, damage type resistance, damage type immunity, damage type vulnerability, sepecial senses (Darkvision, Tremorsense, Trusesight, and Blindsight),</li>

<li>   Spells added - when you have the Summon spells selected, you can add the summoned creature to your Hero. Pick its type (subrace) and adjust the "Spell Level" in the In-Play tab to match what slot you summoned it at. Otherwise they default to the lowest level you could cast it at. If you receive the spell through something other than a class (scroll, item, etc.), add the "Summon Creature" adjustment to enable it.</li>
<li>   Subclasses added</li>
<li>   Variant Class Features added. Use the new Optional feature "Always show Tasha's Variants" to see the tab. Select what kind of variant features you want to use on your character and menus will dynamically update to show the options for your class.</li>
<li>   Variant Racial Features added. Use the new Optional feature "Always show Tasha's Variants" to see the tab. Select what kind of variant features you want to use on your character and menus will dynamically update to show the options for your race. Note that ASI swaps must be done manually with the use of adjustments, as they're too dynamic to address programatically.</li>
</ul>

<strong>ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES</strong>
<ul>
<li>All - The adjustment selection menu has been lightly reorganized for ease of use.</li>
<li>All - The sources of the 5e Community pack have been re-organized on the Configure Hero screen. UA and MTG sources will now appear underneath the 5e Adventures, which themselves have been put into release order.</li>
<li>All - A handful of deprecated things have been hidden. Some heroes will have to re-select some things, but this should be uncommon.</li>
<li>DMG - Added a new version of the Necklace of Prayer Beads, as the default one doesn't function properly. This will automatically replace that version.</li>
<li>DMG - An adjustment for "Training" has been added (see page 231 of the DMG). It adds 1 bonus feat and a skill proficiency to the hero.</li>
<li>DMG - Major/Minor Beneficial/Detrimental Artifact Properties have been updated to actually function. You'll want to delete out any that are selected in the epic boons tab and re-add them in the new Artifact Properties tab.</li>
<li>DMG - Blessings and Charms have been moved to the Supernatural Gifts tab, to align with how they're described in the DMG.</li>
<li>DMG - Changed firearms to act as "Special" proficiencies required. Though the book considers them martial, subsequent material has made it clear that proficiency with all martial weapons does not automatically equal proficiency with all firearms. To reflect that, they're now Special. The Gunner feat or the new Adjustment "Firearm Proficiency" can be added to the Hero to gain firearm proficiency if you so choose.</li>
<li>GGtR - Tireless Precision has been re-designed. See Known Issues if you are using a Vedalken currently.</li>
<li>MOoT - The Supernatural Gifts tab will now not show up automatically if you have the Mythic Odysseys of Theros source selected. Use the Optional Feature "Always Show Supernatural Gifts Tab" on the Configure Hero screen to see it. This change was made to cut down on clutter for people who want content from that book but don't want to use Supernatural Gifts.</li>
<li>SCAG - Bladesinging updated to match Tasha's, including the removal of the racial restriction. Spells also updated per Tasha's and Errata. Also hid magic items from Training in War and Song selection list, and removed the Spiked Armor's "weapon" from all selection lists as well.</li>
<li>UA Modern Magic - Updated to now include firearm proficiencies where appropriate. Note that there is no distinction between side arms and long arms in the DMG, so limitations should be imposed at DM and player discretion.</li>
</ul>

<strong>BUGS</strong>
<ul>
<li>All - Sources added to various items to prevent them from showing up without their source selected.</li>
<li>PHB - We had some duplicate spells from the SRD, like Fire Bolt and Hellish Rebuke. The community pack versions will now automatically replace the SRD versions, even if no sources are selected. You shouldn't even notice this fix happened, other than a reduction in duplicate spells.</li>
<li>SCAG - Corrected Spare the Dying version</li>
<li>XGTE - Fixed the language helper on the Cavalier</li>
</ul>

<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li>GGtR - The old version of Tireless Precision doesn't automatically remove itself to use the new one. If you find yourself with extra proficiencies on your Vedalken, use the "Proficiencies" adjustment to display the tab of the same name. Right click and delete the skill and tool you originally chose for Tireless Precision, then re-choose them in the new Tireless Precision tab.</li>
<li>ERFLW/TCOE - Sometimes, infused items will not behave properly when equipped. Clicking/changing anything else on the hero will fix this immediately, but things may appear wonky for a second.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v2.5 November 9, 2020</strong>
<strong>NEW RELEASES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eberron: Rising from the Last War/Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron - Aberrant Dragonmark replaced, Greater Aberrant Dragonmark added. Due to Hero Lab limitations, there are some manual components to tracking used Hit Dice for this ability.</li>
<li>Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes - Fiendish Boons and Cults added. Using the eponymous adjustment will add a tab for selecting Demonic Boons and/or Devil Cults. The variant cambion features can be accessed through choosing the appropriate fiend in this tab, too.</li>
<li>Mythic Odysseys of Theros - Races, subclasses, background, deities (and their benefits), and supernatural gifts added.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants - Cleric Blessed Strikes added.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic - Added full UA. Special thanks to MardukBathory for providing the descriptive text, which was used for all the class features. Please see the known issues section.</li>
</ul>

<strong>NHANCEMENTS & CHANG</strong>
<ul>
<li>2020 Errata Implemented - A lot more than this, but note: the Kobold and Orc have had their negative stat modifiers removed. Use an Ability Score adjustment if you want to go back. The VGM Orc now matches the Wildemount and Eberron version, so the newer one has been deprecated. Users of the newer version will need to re-select the VGM version when they update.</li>
<li>EGTW - Hollow One moved to the Supernatural Gifts tab.</li>
</ul>

<strong>BUGS</strong>
<ul>
<li>BGDIA - Fixed incorrect version of Detect Magic on two monsters. Added cone size on Hollyphant Trumpet.</li>
<li>MM - Added missing attack and damage type on Spined Devil</li>
<li>MTG - Added sources to Amonkahet deities</li>

</ul>

<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most 2.3 issues still ongoing, but plans to fix them are in place.</li>
<li>UA Modern Magic - The UA indicates that Sidearms and Long arms are in the DMG, but they are not. A handful of features in this UA use them, so DMs and players may need to either create some homebrew weapons of their own, or use a combination of existing weapons and proficiency adjustments to achieve something closer to what they want.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v2.4 March 29, 2020</strong>
<strong>NEW RELEASES</strong>
<ul>

<li>PHB - Fixed a bug where the Wild Shape adjustment was incorrectly reporting an error that a minion wasn't a minion.</li>
<li>MTOF - removed a tag that was flagging the Deathlock Mastermind as a familiar.</li>
<li>WGTE/ERFTLW - Fixed a bug where the Warforged would erroneously report that you didn't select enough tool proficiencies.</li>
</ul>

<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most 2.3 issues still ongoing</li>
</ul>

<strong>ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Custom Output for Fantasy Grounds - You can find the discussion thread on the forums http://forums.wolflair.com/showthread.php?t=60176</li>
<li>DMG - Minor and major beneficial and detrimental properties have been added as Epic Boons with informational drop-down menus.</li>
<li>PHB (Merchant variant) - There is a new background choice for folks that wanted a Guild Merchant and decided to choose two languages but no Navigator's Tool proficiency. This will show up in the background lists as "Guild Merchant (Lang. Var.)".</li>
<li>PHB - Magic Initiate and Ritual Caster feats have been enhanced so that when Find Familiar is chosen, the Add a Familiar dialogue link will show up on the 1st class assigned to a PC. The link will show up on either the Spells tab or the Class tab. This feat does not work on NPCs, they will need to still use the Add Familiar or Add Companion adjustments.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old - Added the Scout subclass for Fighter.</li>
<li>2018 Errata Implemented - A lot of the 2018 errata changes are part of the SRD, which is controlled in Hero Lab by LWD. We've updated whatever is outside the SRD</li>
<li>SKT - A pig statblock has been added. You heard me.</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUGS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple - Many classes, langauges, races, and items have had missing sources added to them, and they will now only show up when the appropriate source is selected.</li>
<li>CoS - Haunted One background now grants 2 skill proficiencies as per errata corrections published.</li>
<li>DMG - Boon of Quick Casting was only working for classes that memorized spells, this has been fixed to include casters like warlocks and bards that spontaneously cast spells known.</li>
<li> DMG - Pelor's alignment has been fixed</li>
<li> DMG - Wave and the Staff of the Adder have been fixed to not show as standard weapons</li>
<li> LMOP - The Spider Staff has had its poison damage added</li>
<li> SCAG - Barbarian (Path of the Totem Warrior) - The Tree Ghost totem ability was not removing the Speak with Animals spell from the UI on the iPad. This has been addressed. </li>
<li> SCAG/XGTE (Sword Coast & Xanathars) - Rogue (Mastermind) - _Master of Intrigue_ was not granting the disguise kit and forgery kit profiencies as expected. This has been fixed. </li>
<li> UA Gothic - Fixed the Fighter Archetype of Monster Hunter for the Bonus Proficiencies.</li>
<li> UA Starter Spells - Fixed classes for many spells.</li>
<li> XGTE (Xanathar's Guide) - _Flames of Phlegethos_ and _Infernal Constitution_ were generating errors for the community Tiefling. Changed the prerequisite scripting to reflect the community replacements. </li>
<li> XGTE - All spells are now no longer marked "Not Allowed for Adventurers League Characters"</li>
<li> XGTE - Forge Domain abilities from _Soul of the Forge_ and _Saint of Forge and Fire_ were being granted at 1st level, this has been fixed and they properly add now. </li>
<li> XGTE - Path of the Kensei - Longsword and other weapons allowed by the _Path of the Kensei_ selections were not being marked as martial arts weapons and receiving the proper attribute bonus or damage at high level. This has been fixed.</li>
<li> XGTE - The Celestial (Warlock) - _Celestial Resilience_ was granting temporary hit points before level 10. This has been fixed and the entire adjustment will now show up as a temporary hit point pool on the In-Play tab so that the temporary hit points can be shown and removed correctly. An adjustment has also been created so that other players affected can choose the adjustment and get a temporary hit point pool with proper naming and behavior. </li>
<li> XGTE - Warlock Invocations - _Improved Pact Weapon_ was not granting the +1 bonus to magical weapons that did not already have a bonus (e.g. Flame Tongue weapons). This has been fixed. </li>
<li> XGTE - Pact Weapon/Hexblade - When a two-handed magic weapon was selected to be the Pact of the Blade weapon, the Hexblade Hex Warrior weapon selection was returning an invalid selection dialogue and an error was thrown. This is now functioning as intended. </li>
</ul>
<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li> Artificer (2019): Spells and cantrips must be manually added at level 1 due to programming limitations with Hero Lab. Should function normally at level 2 and beyond. Multiclassing rounds down, not up like it should, also due to programming limitations. Thus the Artificer is incomplete, and will remain that way without changes from LWD.</li>
<li> GGR - Tireless Precision's implementation is suboptimal and doesn't play nice with other proficiency adds</li>
<li> GGR - The Elf and Human races cannot be given the GGtR source</li>
<li> DMG - The amount of ammunition loaded into a firearm isn't currently trackable</li>
<li> DMG - Minor/major beneficial/detrimental item properties show up as selectable Epic Boons and have no scripting to implement their features.</li>
</ul>

<li>Unearthed Arcana - The Ranger, Revised - The Ranger (2016) variant class' Fighting Styles were stacking with Fighting Styles earned from other classes or features, this has been fixed. The _'broken'_ fighting styles will show up with ' - Depreciated' added to the end of their names. The Depreciated fighting styles have been removed from the choices presented when Fighting Style is selected again, so only Fighting Styles that haven't been earned via another class or feat will show up on the selection dialog. </li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana - Gothic Heroes - The revenant race is depreciated. Dragonborn characters gain a Revenant draconic ancestry, which prompts for the original draconic ancestry and modifies the breath weapon appropriately. Many races with subrace options gain an appropriate Revenant subrace option. Finally, Humans and many other PC races were granted a Revenant variant racial trait. Select the '5e Unearthed Arcana - Gothic Heroes' source in Configure Hero (Ctrl-K) to explore the revised options.</li>
<li>DnD5E.info Custom Output (dpmcalister) - Character sheet fixes.</li>
